title: 'React Day Berlin: Destructuring Distributed Tracing'
description:
  'Distributed tracing is a powerful technique that allows you to track the flow
  and timing of requests as they navigate through a system. By linking
  operations and requests between multiple services, distributed tracing
  provides valuable insights into app performance and helps identify
  bottlenecks. In this talk I will explain the concept of Distributed Tracing by
  walking you through how monitoring tools build tracing solutions.'
