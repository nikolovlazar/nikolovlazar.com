title: 'Mobile: The Future is Declarative'
description: "Two of the leading native mobile platforms are native Android and iOS, both of which have had interesting innovations recently. With the introductions of Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI, developing native apps looks very similar to developing React Native or Flutter apps. Both React Native and Flutter have a declarative approach from the start, but with Android and iOS now joining the declarative bandwagon, we can see that the future of mobile development is declarative."
