title: 'Web Fonts and the Dreaded Cumulative Layout Shift'
description:
  'How frustrating is it when you’ve just landed on a web page, you click on a
  certain element and an ad or something else pops up and you end up clicking
  that thing instead? That’s a layout shift, which is bad for the user’s
  experience and the later they happen, the worse it is.'
