title: 'Harnessing Distributed Tracing for Application Performance Optimization'
description:
  'Distributed tracing is a powerful technique that allows you to track the flow
  and timing of requests as they navigate through a system. By linking
  operations and requests between multiple services, distributed tracing
  provides valuable insights into system performance and helps identify
  bottlenecks. In this blog post, we will delve into the benefits of distributed
  tracing, explore its relevance for various application architectures, and
  uncover how it operates behind the scenes.'
