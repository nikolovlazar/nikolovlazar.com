title: 'Fixing memoization-breaking re-renders in React'
description:
  "useMemo doesn't mean your React component won't rerender. ðŸ‘‰ Comp A renders B
  and passes down a callback through its props. B is memoized, but still
  rerenders every time A rerenders. You're missing 'useCallback' on the callback"
