Hey, I'm Lazar Nikolov. I'm a developer advocate at
[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome). I live in Toronto, Canada, but originally
I'm from North Macedonia. As a fullstack engineer, I enjoy building interesting
pet projects from scratch. Of course, just like any normal developer I end up
abandoning them. I'm a super curious fellow and I'm always up to learn something
new. Aside from learning new things, I enjoy live streaming on YouTube and
creating courses for [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

## How everything started
Hello.
