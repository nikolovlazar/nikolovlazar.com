Hey, I'm Lazar Nikolov. I'm a developer advocate at
[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome). I live in Toronto, Canada, but I'm
originally from North Macedonia. As a full-stack engineer, I enjoy building
interesting pet projects from scratch. Of course, just like any normal developer
I end up abandoning them. I'm a super curious fellow and I'm always up to learn
something new. Aside from learning new things, I enjoy live streaming on
[YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nikolovlazar) and creating courses for
[egghead.io](https://egghead.io/q/resources-by-lazar-nikolov).
